    <div id="about-me">
        <p>I am a developer from Seattle currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems
            at Seattle Pacific University! Outside of programming, I am a musician who plays guitar and drums but am also currently learning to sing. Additionally, I play Nintendo games in my free time, particularly Mario Kart, and upload some of my gameplay to my YouTube channel! I hope you enjoy navigating through my portfolio. Thank you.

            <h2>SPU GradPro</h2>
            <p>For my senior capstone project, myself and some of my peers are building a game in Unity which aims to gamify Computer Science concepts while immersing a student in the college experience at Seattle Pacific University. This project is built using C# and will be deployed on the web upon completion.</p>

            <h2>Quotes on Quotes</h2>
            <p>In an Application Programming class at University, myself and a team of two others built an application allowing a user to store memorable quotes. This project utilized sqLite3, Qt (C++ and SQL), and GitHub as our code repository.</p>

            <h2>Digital Application Development</h2>
            <p>Myself and a group of friends built a Mobile Application which digitized membership information for a nonprofit organization. This project used C#, MySQL, and Xamarin for multi-platform compatibility.</p>
