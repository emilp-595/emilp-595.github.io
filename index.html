        <p>My name is Emil Parappuram and I am a developer from Seattle currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems
            at Seattle Pacific University! Outside of programming, I am a musician who plays guitar and drums but am also currently learning to sing. Additionally, I play Nintendo games in my free time, particularly Mario Kart, and upload some of my gameplay to my YouTube channel! I hope you enjoy navigating through my portfolio. Thank you.
