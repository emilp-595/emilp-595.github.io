    <div id="about-me">
        <p>My name is Emil Parappuram and I am a developer from Seattle currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems
            at Seattle Pacific University! Outside of programming, I am a musician who plays guitar and drums but am also currently learning to sing. Additionally, I play Nintendo games in my free time, particularly Mario Kart, and upload some of my gameplay to my YouTube channel! I hope you enjoy navigating through my portfolio. Thank you.

            <h3>SPU GradPro</h3>
            <p>For my senior capstone project, myself and some of my peers are building a game in Unity which aims to gamify Computer Science concepts while immersing a student in the college experience at Seattle Pacific University. This project is built using C# and will be deployed on the web upon completion. For this project, I served primarily as the ScrumMaster and Project Manager.</p>

            <h3>Mario Kart Wii QueueBot</h3>
            <p>For Mario Kart Wii's Solo Ladder system, I worked with two other community members to implement a Discord bot which allows users to queue into a competitive setting and play a match at set times. This bot was implemented using Python and Discord developer integrations. Through this project, I gained my first experience developing a bot and also experienced real-time interactions with a customer detailing requirements and desired fixes.</p>

            <h3>Digital Application Development</h3>
            <p>Myself and a group of friends built a Mobile Application which digitized membership information for a nonprofit organization. This project used C#, MySQL, and Xamarin for multi-platform compatibility. For this project, I was a developer responsible for ensuring a secure connection with the host database and designing various assets used in the application. Through this experience, I learned about connecting a program with a database and user authentication via the cloud.</p>
